Ftcr is an open-source watchOS only app for downloading images from an URL. You can download a single image or download all images from a html webpage.


## Download

*Requires minimum WatchOS 10.0*

## Tip

In addition to downloading a single image, Ftcr also supports batch downloading images from a webpage. 
When given a URL to a webpage, Ftcr will match image URLs from the HTML content and download them all. A great use case is to go to a folder in your computer with many images and `python -m http.server` to serve the folder. Then you can download all images from the folder to your watch.
